CONTEXT{10003424,10004118};A ID{0,7157,12000004=p53/MicroRNA-34} axis regulates ID{6615=Snail1}-dependent ID{4000000,4001837,6000153,6802426,9014584=cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition}. CONTEXT{6000153,6802426};Through binding to the ID{406985=miR-200c} promoter, ID{7157=p53} induces ID{406985=miR-200c} expression and consequently attenuates ID{4000000,4001837=epithelial-mesenchymal transition} and reduces ID{10000000,10004118=stem-cell}-like population in ID{9000000,9202909=breast cancer} by targeting ID{0,648,6935=ZEB1 and BMI1}, respectively (Figure 3) . CONTEXT{10004118};A recent study concluded that ID{7157=p53} also inhibits ID{4000000,4001837=Epithelial-mesenchymal transition} by regulating the expression of ID{406985=miR-200c} (36). CONTEXT{10003446};It was reported that ID{7157=p53} represses ID{4000000,4001837,10000340=epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cells} (45). ID{7157=p53} is one of the target genes of ID{406911=miR-125b} (46). CONTEXT{10000340};Also ID{406937=microRNA-145} is directly regulated by wild-type ID{7157=p53} (27-30), and the loss of wild-type ID{7157=p53} function occurs in many ID{9000000,9017834=prostate cancer}, therefore, we reasoned that wild-type ID{7157=p53} may play a role in regulating ID{4000000,4001837,9014584=epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer cell} stemness of ID{9000000,9017834=prostate cancer} cells and ID{406937=miR-145} may mediate the function of wild-type ID{7157=p53}. CONTEXT{10004118};Our findings demonstrate that wild-type ID{7157=p53} represses ID{4000000,4001837=epithelial-mesenchymal transition} and stemness of ID{10000000,11013519=PC-3 cells} at least partially by mediating the ID{406937=miR-145}. CONTEXT{11013519};wild-type ID{7157=p53} represses ID{4000000,4001837=epithelial-mesenchymal transition} and anti-ID{406937=miR-145} rescues the effect in ID{10000000,11013519=PC-3 cells}. CONTEXT{11013519};wild-type ID{7157=p53} represses ID{4000000,4001837=epithelial-mesenchymal transition} by modulating ID{406937=miR-145} in ID{10000000,11013519=PC-3 cells}. CONTEXT{11013519};In the present study, we found that the ectopic expression of wild-type ID{7157=p53} inhibited migration, invasion, ID{4000000,4001837,4204612,9016100=epithelial-mesenchymal transition, colony formation, tumor} sphere formation and expression of ID{0,960,4609,5460,9314=CD44, Oct4, c-Myc and Klf4} in PC-3 ID{9000000,9017834=prostate cancer} cells, and enhanced ID{406937=miR-145} expression in ID{10000000,11013519=PC-3 cells}. CONTEXT{11013519};In ID{9000000,9017834=prostate cancer}, although some studies have showed that mutant ID{7157=p53} gain of function promoted ID{9000000,9014584=cancer} development and ID{9000000,9003646=metastasis} (5,35-38), there are hardly any studies on the role of wild-type ID{7157=p53} in ID{9000000,9003646,9017834=prostate cancer metastasis}.We found that wild-type ID{7157=p53} repressed invasion and migration, and suppressed ID{4000000,4001837=epithelial-mesenchymal transition}, which is a key step of the progression of ID{9000000,9016100=tumor} cell ID{9000000,9003646=metastasis, and cancer} ID{10000000,10004118=stem cells} properties in ID{10000000,11013519=PC-3 cells}, which might be the critical drivers of ...;These findings provide evidences that loss of wild-type ID{7157=p53} may promote the ID{9000000,9014584,9017834=metastasis of prostate cancer} by elevating migration, invasion, ID{4000000,4001837=epithelial-mesenchymal transition} and stemness of ID{9000000,9014584=cancer} cells. CONTEXT{6000033};Inhibition or overexpression of the ID{12000001=miR-200} family affected ID{7157=p53}-regulated ID{4000000,4001837=epithelial-mesenchymal transition} by altering ID{0,6935,9839=ZEB1 and ZEB2} expression (10). CONTEXT{8800110,8800622};Collectively, these findings indicate that ID{406937=miR-145} is a mediator of wild-type ID{7157=p53}-regulated ID{4000000,4001837=epithelial-mesenchymal transition}. CONTEXT{11013519,11013519};Although ID{0,406985,407040=miR-34a and miR-200c} mediated ID{7157=p53}-regulated ID{4000000,4001837,9014584=epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cancer cells} mainly through targeting ID{4000000,4001837=epithelial-mesenchymal transition} regulators ID{0,6615,6935,9839=Snail1, ZEB1 and ZEB2} (8,10,42), our results suggested that ID{406937=miR-145} might mediate ID{7157=p53}-regulated ID{4000000,4001837,11013519=epithelial-mesenchymal transition of PC-3 cells} by CONTEXT{11013519};Therefore, ID{406937=miR-145} may mediate wild-type ID{7157=p53}-regulated ID{4...

CONTEXT{7000383,8801582,10000096,7000383};Additionally, the central administration of an ID{5020=Oxytocin} antiserum abolishes the ID{4000000,4060208=proestrus} ID{3000092=luteinizing hormone} peak , whereas ID{5020=Oxytocin} induces ID{2796=GnRH} release from ID{10000000,8801582=hypothalamic explants} on the afternoon of ID{4000000,4060208=proestrus} , thus supporting the pivotal role of ID{5020=Oxytocin} in ID{2796=GnRH} release. CONTEXT{8801582};Also, it has been shown that ID{1267744=noradrenaline} and ID{5020=oxytocin} stimulate ID{2796=GnRH} release by activating the ID{4842=nNOS} system. CONTEXT{10000096,10000096,8803218};Similarly, ID{5020=oxytocin} also induces ID{2796=GnRH} release from ID{10000000,8801582=hypothalamic explants} , and ID{5020=oxytocin} antagonists block the ID{4000000,4060208=pro-oestrus} LH surge . CONTEXT{8801582};In addition, ID{10000000,8801429=brain} ID{5020=oxytocin} modulates the secretion of ID{0,551,2688,2796,5617,7200=thyrotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, growth hormone, prolactin and vasopressin} ( ), many of which are also immune regulators ( ). CONTEXT{8801429};Using ID{10000000,8801582=hypothalamic explants} from male ID{7000383=rats}, one of our laboratories recently showed that neonatal pulsatile ID{2796=GnRH} secretion in vitro is facilitated by ID{5020=oxytocin} and that this stimulatory effect is mimicked by ID{1215412=prostaglandin E2 (7)}. CONTEXT{8801582,7000383};Using medial basal ID{10000000,8801582=hypothalamic explants} obtained from adult male ID{7000383=rats}, acceleration of ID{2796=GnRH} pulsatile release by ID{5020=oxytocin} concentrations as low as 10-10 M was previously reported (5). CONTEXT{8801582,7000383};That this is an important site of action in mediating ID{5020=oxytocin}-induced ID{2796=GnRH} release is suggested by the previous observation that during the preovulatory ID{2796=GnRH} release, a stimulatory effect of ID{5020=oxytocin} requires the presence of the ID{10000000,8803218=preoptic area} in addition to the median eminence (6). CONTEXT{8803218};In summary, our results show that ID{5020=oxytocin} can act on the immature female ID{10000000,8801582=hypothalamus} to accelerate pulsatile ID{2796=GnRH} release and to advance the onset of female puberty. CONTEXT{8801582};Similarly, Gambacciani et al. (1986) have suggested that ID{5020=oxytocin} can inhibit in vitro release of ID{2796=GnRH} by a receptor mechanism operating at the level of neuro-secretory terminals in the median eminence. CONTEXT{8803218};Moreover, ID{5020=oxytocin} has been shown to stimulate ID{2796=GnRH} release from medial basal ID{10000000,8801582=hypothalamic explants} in male ID{7000383=rats} [42] and to stimulate ID{2796=GnRH} secretion on the afternoon of ID{4000000,4060208=proestrus} in the cycling female ID{7000383=rat} [43]. CONTEXT{8801582,7000383,7000383};In the present study, we showed that ID{5020=oxytocin} could cause pulsatile ID{2796=GnRH} secretion to occur from explants obtained in late ID{10000000,8802727=fetal} life, suggesting a role for this factor in the initiation of pulsatile ID{2796=GnRH} secretion neonatally. CONTEXT{8802727};Moreover, an ID{5020=oxytocin} antagonist was able to decrease pulsatile ID{2796=GnRH} secretion by increasing the ID{2796=GnRH} interpulse interval, and this effect on ID{2796=GnRH} remained in postnatal life at 15 days. CONTEXT{8801582,7000383,8802727};Because of these associations, we hypothesized that ID{5020=oxytocin} controls release of ID{2796=LHRH} into the ID{10000000,8800375=portal vessels}, thereby stimulating release of ID{3000092=luteinizing hormone} from the ID{10000000,7000383,8800564=anterior pituitary gland of rats} of both sexes (8). CONTEXT{8800375,7000383,8800564};Interestingly, ID{5020=oxytocin} not only inhibited food intake in ID{3952=leptin}-resistant ID{7000383=rats}, but also induced stimulatory responses in terms of ID{2796=GnRH} secretion and puberty onset in female ID{7000383=rats} [43]; these effects are reminiscent of those induced by ID{1009662=nesfatin-1} [35]. CONTEXT{7000383,8020307};ID{5020=oxytocin} induced a dose-related (10(-13) to 10(-9) M) inhibition of both basal and KCl-stimulated ID{2796=GnRH} release from the mediobasal ID{10000000,8801582=hypothalamus}.

CONTEXT{8801582};In in vitro studies, the formation of ID{1246879=carbon monoxide} within the ID{10000000,8801582=hypothalamus} has been associated with inhibition of the release of hormones such as ID{0,551,1392,5020=corticotropin-releasing hormone, arginine vasopressin and oxytocin} involved in hypothalamo-ID{10000000,8010306=pituitary-adrenal axis} activation and, conversely, with stimulation of ID{2796=luteinising hormone-releasing hormone} release, thus suggesting that the gas may have a ID{10000000,8802510=neuroendocrine} role which may be to prevent over-exuberant activation of the hypothalamo-ID{10000000,8010306=pituitary-adrenal axis} and inhibition of ID{4000000,4122414=reproductive processes} within the ID{10000000,8801582=hypothalamus} during ID{13000016=stress}. CONTEXT{8801582,8010306,8802510,8010306,8801582};The results demonstrated a sensitive, dose-dependent ability of ID{5020=oxytocin} to stimulate ID{2796=GnRH} release from ID{4000000,4060208=proestrus} basal ID{10000000,8801582=hypothalamic explants} which was observed only in ID{4000000,4060208=proestrus}.

CONTEXT{8801582};Because ID{2796=LHRH} mediates ID{4000000,4107617=mating behavior}, we hypothesized that ID{5020=oxytocin} would stimulate the ID{2796=LHRH} release that, after secretion into the hypophyseal ID{10000000,8800375=portal vessels}, mediates ID{3000092=luteinizing hormone} release from the ID{10000000,8803038=pituitary}. CONTEXT{8800375,8803038};Consequently, we incubated medial basal ID{10000000,8801582=hypothalamic explants} and demonstrated that ID{5020=oxytocin} (10 -7-10 -10 M) induced ID{2796=LHRH} release via ID{1267744=Norepinephrine} stimulation of nNOS. CONTEXT{8801582};Therefore, ID{5020=oxytocin} may be very important as a stimulator of ID{2796=LHRH} release. CONTEXT{8801582};Consequently, we determined the effect of prazosin, an ID{12104937=alpha1-adrenergic receptor} blocker, on the ID{2796=LHRH} release induced by ID{5020=oxytocin}. CONTEXT{8801582};Indeed, prazocin, which previous experiments had shown blocked the ID{1267744=norepinephrine}-induced but not basal ID{2796=LHRH} release, had no effect on basal release but completely blocked ID{5020=oxytocin} (10-7 M)-induced ID{2796=LHRH} release (ID{31000000=Fig.} 6). CONTEXT{8801582};Not only does ID{5020=oxytocin} stimulate release of ID{2796=LHRH}, which is bound for the ID{10000000,8803038=pituitary gland} where it releases ID{3000092=luteinizing hormone}, but also the ID{2796=LHRH} release stimulated by ID{5020=oxytocin} may play a role in ID{4000000,4107617=mating behavior} in the male ID{7000383=rat}, because intraventricular injection of ID{5020=oxytocin} produced ID{4000000,4143084=penile erection}.

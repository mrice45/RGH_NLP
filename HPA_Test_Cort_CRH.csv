"DirectRegulation: cortisol ---> CRH","Blocking ID{1392=CRH}-stimulated increases in ID{1409770=ACTH} and ID{1100010=cortisol} is a fundamental test of the ID{4000000,4000473=pituitary activity} of ID{1392=CRH} antagonists. CONTEXT{8803038}|At term, increased ID{1100010=cortisol} antagonizes ID{1203078=progesterone} in binding to ID{2908=glucocorticoid receptor} to increase ID{1392=CRH} but inhibit ID{3248=prostaglandin dehydrogenase} (6, 26).

CONTEXT{8803028}|Increased ID{10000000,8802727=fetal} ID{1100010=cortisol} can be derived from elevated maternal ID{1100010=cortisol} concentrations via a high concentration gradient plus maternal ID{1100010=cortisol}-induced stimulation of ID{1392=corticotrophin releasing hormone} and ID{1810328=prostaglandins} in ID{10000000,8802722,8802911=placenta and fetal membranes}.

CONTEXT{8800375,8010306}|The source of this elevation in ID{1100010=cortisol} could be in part secondary to increases in free ID{1392=CRH} as ID{4000000,4107565=pregnancy} progresses (28).|Preoperative ID{1409770=ACTH} and ID{1100010=cortisol} (both P < 0.0001), but not ID{3952=leptin} levels increased after ID{1392=CRH}.|Inefficient ID{1100010=cortisol} synthesis signals the ID{10000000,8801582,8803038=hypothalamus and pituitary} to increase ID{1392=CRH} and ID{1409770=ACTH}, respectively.

CONTEXT{8803038}|These results show that the control of ID{1409770=ACTH} secretion is influenced not only by independent action of secretagogues such as ID{0,551,1392=CRH and AVP}, or inhibitors such as ID{1100010=cortisol}, but by a complex interaction of these factors with one another.
